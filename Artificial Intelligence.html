    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <h4><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or machine to perform tasks that normally require human cognition, such as problem solving, decision making, and learning. The goal of AI is to create systems that can mimic human cognition and automate a wide range of tasks.

        There are many different approaches to AI, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision, and expert systems. Each of these approaches has its own set of techniques and applications.
        
        AI has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, from healthcare and finance to transportation and retail. It is being used to develop innovative products and services, improve efficiency and productivity, and enhance decision-making processes.
        
        However, the development and deployment of AI also raises important ethical and social questions, such as issues related to bias, transparency, and accountability. As AI continues to advance, it is important to address these concerns in a responsible and thoughtful manner.</h4></p>
